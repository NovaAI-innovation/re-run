Geopolitical conflict in 2025 is marked by intense competition among major global powers, increasing the likelihood of military, economic, and cyber clashes, particularly in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific. Key areas of concern include the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, the strategic rivalry between the US and China (especially concerning Taiwan), and rising tensions involving Iran, Russia, and North Korea.

The war in Ukraine continues with renewed offensives and significant casualties, remaining in a destructive stalemate. In the Middle East, violence in Gaza, the fall of Syria's Assad regime, and hostilities between Israel and Iran contribute to instability, with potential for broader regional escalation.

US-China relations are strained by increased Chinese military activity around Taiwan, raising fears of accidents or escalation. North Korea has adopted a more assertive military stance, including a defense pact with Russia, which further destabilizes the Korean Peninsula.

Globally, economic risks are on the rise due to protectionism, fragile supply chains, and the threat that conflicts pose to critical resources like semiconductors and energy. Regional conflicts can quickly lead to widespread economic, energy, and humanitarian crises because of the interconnectedness of global trade.

In essence, the geopolitical landscape in 2025 is characterized by a dangerous combination of regional wars, great power rivalry, and economic nationalism, all increasing the risk of escalation, supply chain disruptions, and potential multi-theater conflicts involving nuclear-armed nations.
